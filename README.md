# Arduino-Simulator-OSHW-Screening-Tasks-1-3
A minimal web-based Arduino simulator built for the FOSSEE OSHW screening tasks. It supports drag-and-drop circuit creation, automatic pin wiring, configurable digital pins, Arduino code generation, and logic-level simulation where a push button controls an LED, closely mirroring real Arduino behavior.
